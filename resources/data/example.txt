# Tesseract AI — Product Documentation

## Overview

Tesseract AI is an advanced desktop application built with Electron, React, and TypeScript.
It provides a powerful AI-assisted workspace for knowledge workers, developers, and researchers.
The application supports multi-platform distribution across Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Core Features

### AI Chat Interface
Tesseract AI includes a real-time streaming chat interface powered by LangChain JS and the OpenAI API.
Users can create multiple chat threads, each with its own conversation history.
Messages are rendered with full Markdown support, including syntax-highlighted code blocks.
The system uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to answer questions grounded in uploaded documents.

### Thread Management
Each conversation is stored as a thread. Threads are listed in the sidebar and persist across sessions.
Users can create, switch between, and delete threads. Only one thread can be running at a time.
Thread titles are auto-generated from the first user message.

### Document RAG
Users can index local files (TXT, Markdown, PDF) and query them using natural language.
The RAG pipeline uses:
- LangChain JS for orchestration
- OpenAI Embeddings (text-embedding-3-small) for vector encoding
- MemoryVectorStore for in-process vector storage
- RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter with chunkSize=1000, chunkOverlap=200
- ChatOpenAI (gpt-4o-mini by default) for answer generation

### Settings and Model Management
Users can configure API tokens and select AI models per provider.
Supported providers: Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Meta, Mistral.
Settings are persisted to a local JSON file in the Electron userData directory.

## Architecture

### Electron Multi-Process Design
- Main Process (Node.js): handles file system, AI agent, RAG pipeline, IPC routing
- Renderer Process (React): UI layer using Redux Toolkit for state management
- Preload Script: secure contextBridge between main and renderer

### State Management
Redux Toolkit manages all client-side state:
- Chat threads and messages are stored in the `chatSlice`
- Agent running state (`isAgentRunning`, `runningThreadId`) is globally tracked
- Theme and language preferences are handled via IPC events from the Electron menu

### IPC Channel Design
All main-process capabilities are exposed through typed IPC channels:
- `agent:run` / `agent:cancel` — streaming AI responses
- `rag:index` / `rag:query` / `rag:cancel` — RAG pipeline
- `store-*` — settings persistence
- `fs-*` — filesystem operations
- `clipboard-*` — clipboard access

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- Ctrl+Shift+I  — Toggle DevTools
- Ctrl+R        — Reload renderer
- Enter         — Send chat message
- Shift+Enter   — Insert newline in chat input

## File Format

Tesseract AI uses the `.tsrct` file extension for its native document format.
Double-clicking a `.tsrct` file opens it in a new window on all platforms.
